All of these images were taken from patreon, compiled by Josh. He sent them all messages asking permission to use them, but until they get back to us, we don't know if they are education use or not, so we may not be able to use them in our game. Until we find out, go ahead and use them, but be prepared to create your own. Or have Ben or Sam or someone create them.
